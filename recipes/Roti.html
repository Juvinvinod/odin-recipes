    <h3>A bread of joy</h3>
    <p>A an unleavened griddle bread from India which is similar to pita bread. It is also known as roti. Ideally, I use
        the traditional Indian roti griddle called a 'tava.'</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups durum wheat flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¾ cup water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, salt, water and oil, until the mixture pulls away from the sides.
            Turn the dough out onto a well floured surface. Knead until smooth and pliable, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat an unoiled skillet or tava to medium high heat. Divide dough into 12 equal parts, form into rounds
            and cover with a damp cloth. Flatten the balls with the palm of your hand, then use a rolling pin to roll
            out each piece into a 6 to 8 inch diameter round.</li>
        <li>Cook the roti for 1 minute before turning over, then turn again after another minute. The roti should have
            some darker brown spots when finished. Best served warm.</li>
    </ol>
